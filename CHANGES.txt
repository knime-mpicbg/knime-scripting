VERSION		v3.1.0

INTERNAL

* R integration restructured and transfer from/to R improved

ENHANCEMENTS / FEATURES

R nodes now can

- transfer KNIME color/size/shape model
- transfer rowIDs
- directly 'open external'
- transfer domain values
- transfer flow variables
- handles empty tables correctly
- supports double, int, long, boolean and string and ommits other column types

ISSUES

* fixes #67: Rserve process hangs under Windows after R-Plot node failure
* fixes #35: RGG line break bug after Edit Template
* fix: OpenInPython does not work under Windows (no window opens after execution)
* Use new Rserve version 1.7 #42 
* Include Open in R funcionality into R plot node and R snippet node #4 
* Generic plot node should get image outport #66 
* Stop support of old R variable names #54 
* transfer R workspace with generic nodes #47 
* Support domain values from KNIME as levels in R #43 
* row ids should be used as row names in R-data.frame #9 

NEW NODES

* Generic R nodes (new versions)
	R port now acts as workspace transfer


======================================================================================================
2015-05-28
VERSION		v2.0.4

ISSUES

Scripting
* fixes #59: template configuration dialog has too much empty space

Matlab
* fixes NullPointer-Exception when executing a matlab node.
* Simplifying the Matlab controller (only to work on the local machine)

R
* undo row names support as pushing row names like this suffers from an RServe-bug
* closes issue #42: Use new Rserve version 1.7
* changed R icons and fixed node types in xml and added icon for splash screen

======================================================================================================
2015-02-18
VERSION		v2.0.2

ISSUES

scripting
* closes #49: remove output tab from snippet node (main changes in AbstractTableScriptingNodeModel)

Python
* part of #55: integer columns are transfered as float to allow missing values
* some changes for better NaN/missing value handling with python snippet node (not yet finished)
* fixes #56: Python plot fails under windows

R
* fixes #53: check if plot was generated and give error message
* fixes #50: fix R port of generic nodes, return structure of objects transfered via RPort
* fixes #7: RPlot - Null Pointer Exception if plot node contains a nonvalid output path
* closes #10: Plot Overwrite - Warning instead of Error
* fixes #5: Generic OpenInR - pushes rOut instead of kIn
* R-scripting - improve error message if plot file path is invalid (was: reporting Null-Pointer exception)
* enables R-nodes to push row-names for table inputs
